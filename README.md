This is a very **disco** implementation of [godot-ink](https://github.com/paulloz/godot-ink), by [paulloz](https://github.com/paulloz), for a dialogue interface 100% inspired by that of **Disco Elysium**. Like Godot and [Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink)? Love Disco Elysium? Then feel free to help me improve this project (it's far from being perfect).

## ðŸš¨ WARNING!

**This project was created in Godot 3.5.1 Mono on a Windows machine** (I did get to run it on a Linux machine no problem, though).
## Screenshots

## Requirements
* Godot 3.5.1 **Mono version**
* ink 1.0.0

*If you're not sure how to use Godot Mono, I'd recommend you to watch this [guy's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOjOb4Lv_ww&ab_channel=FinePointCGI).*
## Running the project

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Install the godot-ink addon in your project folder. You can find it in [this repo](https://github.com/paulloz/godot-ink) or at [Godot's asset lib](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/846).

That should be all set. **Just before running the main scene, make sure you have your ink story loaded on the InkManager.**
